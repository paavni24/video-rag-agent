Video-RAG MCP Agent
Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Video Understanding
-- Overview
The Video-RAG MCP Agent is a multimodal AI system that enables users to ask natural-language questions about video content and receive grounded, context-aware answers.
It combines video processing, transcript indexing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and an MCP-based agent architecture to enable structured, verifiable reasoning over long videos.
Unlike standard video chatbots that rely purely on generative models, this system retrieves relevant video segments, transcripts, and metadata before generating responses, making outputs more accurate, explainable, and traceable.
